To confirm the whether your agent is genuine, you can either type his/her name on the search tab or you can go to the list of agencies where you'll search for the specific agent. If the agent is not genuine you'll receive a prompt saying he/she is not genuine, if his/she's genuine you'll be allocated to the specific agency he/she is in.
